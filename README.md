**Wanisah** is a simple, hackable, and privacy-focused voice assistant designed to run completely on your local machine. Control your desktop, open apps, and get answers to your questions ‚Äî all without your data ever leaving your computer.

---

## üé• Demo

_It's highly recommended to record a short GIF of the assistant in action and place it here._

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üß† **Offline AI Chat**: Uses a local GPT4All model to understand and respond to conversational queries. No internet required for the AI brain.
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural Voice Interaction**: High-quality text-to-speech provided by Google for a more natural-sounding voice.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Control**: Natively integrates with the Qtile window manager to perform actions like switching workspaces.
- üöÄ **Application Launcher**: Open any application on your system, like Rofi or your terminal, with a simple voice command.
- üåê **Web Launcher**: Quickly open frequently used websites like YouTube or Google.
- ‚úÖ **Zero Configuration**: An easy-to-use installation script handles all dependencies for you.
- üîß **Easily Extendable**: Add your own custom commands with just a few lines of Python.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Operating System**: Arch Linux (or a derivative like Manjaro)
- **Hardware**: A working microphone
- **Internet**: Required for the initial model download and for the high-quality voice, but the core AI is offline

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Getting Wanisah set up is handled by a simple installation script.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
````

> The script installs all system and Python dependencies. You will be prompted for your password for system-level installs.

---

### 2. First Run

Navigate to the project directory and start the assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Note**: The first run downloads the AI model (~2 GB). This is a one-time download and may take a few minutes.

Once ready, the assistant will announce:

> "System online. I am ready to assist you."

## üé§ Usage

Simply speak to the assistant naturally. It is always listening.

| Command                          | Action                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Open Rofi`                      | Launches the Rofi application launcher.    |
| `Go to workspace 2`              | Switches to the second workspace in Qtile. |
| `Open YouTube`                   | Opens youtube.com in your browser.         |
| `What is the capital of France?` | Gets a conversational answer from the AI.  |
| `Tell me a joke`                 | The AI will tell you a joke.               |
| `Jarvis quit`                    | Closes the assistant.                      |

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization: Adding Your Own Commands

You can easily teach Wanisah new tricks by editing the `main.py` file.

1. Open `main.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the `while True:` loop at the bottom of the file.
3. Add a new `elif` block with your desired command and action.

**Example: Add a command to open your file manager (Thunar)**

```python
elif 'open my files' in query:
    speak("Opening your file manager.")
    subprocess.run(["thunar"])
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**"Sorry, I could not recognize your voice."**

This usually means your microphone isn't set up correctly. You can use the PulseAudio Volume Control tool to fix it.

Install it with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
```

Run it by typing `pavucontrol` in your terminal.

Go to the **Input Devices** tab and make sure the correct microphone is selected as the default (click the ‚úîÔ∏è button).
